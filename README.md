# Take-Home-Assignments
Collection of programming assignments from take home assignments as part of the interview process.


### Bank of England
An analytical task as part of the interview process for a data scientist position sitting within the financial market infrastructure supervision team.
As part of this I was given 2 data sources ("LEIsTable" and "SFT_Data") to explore, clean, process, and analyse. To do this I used R markdown ("DS_application_test.Rmd"),
allowing me to build a reproducible report to accompany my analysis and justify assumptions made regarding the data.
Along with this is a CSS file ("styles.css") to format the markdown report.
